#BusStopper

This program is developed for stopping the bus nearby.  
It's using Arduino with Blynk server.  
Main program is Busstopper.ino which is using blynk.  
  
If an user sends signal using blynk application,  
the signal will be sent to a bus driver which has an arduino device,  
then the bus driver will make a decision whether wait for the user for a while or not.  
The signal is different by user's GPS location.
